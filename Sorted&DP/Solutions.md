### Climbing Stairs
This question equals to ask you if you are already at stair i-1 or i-2, you can step 1 or 2 steps relatively to the final stair i. Then this question can be splited to find ans(i) = ans(i-1) + ans(i-2).
There are few existing solutions:
1. Fibonacci Sequence.

2. Iteratively Computing c = a + b, a = b, b = c;

3. Let $Q_n$

   We can compute $F_{n+1}=Q^n[0,0]$

   Initilize $Q_1 = [1,1;1,0]$,  We can compute $F^{n+1}$ by  $Q^n[0][0]$

   Also, we can use quick power multipy method to accelerate above progression to $O(log(n))â€‹$ time.
