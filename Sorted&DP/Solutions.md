### Climbing Stairs
This question equals to ask you if you are already at stair i-1 or i-2, you can step 1 or 2 steps relatively to the final stair i. Then this question can be splited to find ans(i) = ans(i-1) + ans(i-2).
There are few existing solutions:
1. Fibonacci Sequence.
2. Iteratively Computing c = a + b, a = b, b = c;
